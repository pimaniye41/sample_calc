A spark plug manufacturer claims that the lives of its plugs are normally distributed with a mean of 60,000 miles and a standard deviation of 4,000 miles. A random sample of 16 plugs had an average life of 58,500 miles. If the manufacturerâ€™s claim is correct, what is the probability of finding a sample mean of 58,500 or less?
